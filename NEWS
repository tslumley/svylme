1.3-1	problem with formula parsing when svy2relmer has multiple random
	effect terms

	more error messages in svy2relmer

1.3     all pairs by updating marginal likelihood with correlated pairs

1.2     allow for correlated random effects

1.1     allow for non-nested sampling

0.4	get pairwise weights from the survey design object

        Fix for multiple random terms -- restructuring of Z was wrong

	Allow for removal of missing data

	check that model clusters are nested in design PSUs

	an example with more verisimilitude

0.3	Make a start on replicate-weights variances.

0.2   	Allow multiple random terms to get independent random effects

	Profile out the residual variance as well

0.1 	Added standard errors and a slightly bogus example
